`@script`
Welcome to the second Chapter of the course. Previously, we learned what is testing and why it is important to keep our code clean. We also mentioned that it would be great to have a testing framework that could help us handle tests in an easy way. Fortunately, there is already one built-in in the Python standard library.

## Module unittest

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f0c7c75416"
```

`@part1`
testComponent1.py  
testComponent2.py  
testComponent3.py  
...{{1}}


`@script`
It is represented by the module unittest. Writing and inspecting tests, using this module, is a very straightforward task. First of all, it is a good practice to organize your tests in separate modules depending on the component being tested. By convention, they should start with the test prefix.

## Module unittest

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f6fa58ee43"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
**test**Component1.py  
**test**Component2.py  
**test**Component3.py  
...

**testComponent1.py**{{1}}
```
import unittest
```{{1}}
```

class TestComponent1(unittest.TestCase):
```{{2}}
```
    def test_method1(self):
```{{3}}
```
        self.assertTrue(1==1)
```{{4}}
```

    def test_method2(self):

        self.assertFalse(2==3)
```{{5}}


`@script`
Each of these test modules contains the following common structure. First, we have to import the unittest module. Next, we need to create a class extending the TestCase class from unittest module. We are ready to write a test. To do so, we need to create a method within the newly created class. It is important to point out that methods have to start with the test_ prefix, otherwise they won't be recognized by the framework. A test has to contain one or more assert methods from the TestCase class. For example, here we check if the expression under the assertTrue method is True. We can create as much test methods within the class as we want. A similar test using assertFalse method would look like this.

## Running tests

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "8a5aeddd70"
```

`@part1`
**testComponent1.py**{{1}}
```
import unittest
```{{1}}
```

class TestComponent1(unittest.TestCase):
```{{1}}
```
    def test_method1(self):
```{{1}}
```
        self.assertTrue(1==1)
```{{1}}
```

    def test_method2(self):

        self.assertFalse(2==3)
```{{1}}

```
python -m unittest testComponent1
```{{2}}


`@script`
We wrote some tests. How do we run them? It is common to run tests from the command line. Go to the directory where test case is located and run the following command: python -m unittest testComponent1.


---
## Output

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "45393a3685"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
```
python -m unittest testComponent1
```

```
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.001s

OK
```{{1}}


`@script`
You should see the following output. The two dots on the top indicate that both tests within the created class ran successfully. On the bottom you see an OK message indicating success as well. However, don't be fooled by this message because it also appears when you have no tests within your class. What will happen if one of your tests fail?


---
## Failing case

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f6eb469728"
```

`@part1`
```
class TestComponent1(unittest.TestCase):

    ...
```{{1}}
```

    def test_method3(self):

        self.assertTrue(len([1,2,3]) == 0)
```{{2}}

```
..F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_method3 (testComponent1.TestComponent1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testComponent1.py", line 12, in test_method3
    self.assertTrue(len([1, 2, 3]) == 0)
AssertionError: False is not true

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.002s

FAILED (failures=1)
```{{3}}


`@script`
Assume that you add to the class a failing test method. For example, we check if a list containing three elements has zero length. Running the command will result in the following output. In addition to two dots we saw previously there is an F letter indicating that one of your tests failed. The message also indicates which test and which assert method within the test failed.


---
## Error case

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "11a507e14c"
```

`@part1`
```
class TestComponent1(unittest.TestCase):

    ...
```
```

    def test_method3(self):

        self.assertTrue(len([1, 2, 3]) == 0)
```
```

    def test_method4(self):

        self.assertFalse(len([1, 2, 3] == 0))
```{{1}}


`@script`
Also, a test can contain a natural mistake. For example, we inserted a bracket in a wrong place. Don't worry, the test program won't stop executing. Rather, we will see the following output.


---
## Error case

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "e1162af8ea"
```

`@part1`
```
..FE
======================================================================
ERROR: test_method4 (testComponent1.TestComponent1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testComponent1.py", line 15, in test_method4
    self.assertFalse(len([1, 2, 3] == 0))
TypeError: object of type 'bool' has no len()

======================================================================
FAIL: test_method3 (testComponent1.TestComponent1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testComponent1.py", line 12, in test_method3
    self.assertTrue(len([1, 2, 3]) == 0)
AssertionError: False is not true

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 4 tests in 0.002s

FAILED (failures=1, errors=1)
```


`@script`
In addition to the F letter, we got an E letter indicating that an error was raised. You can see the test method that caused this behavior and the corresponding description. Therefore, it is easy to find what to fix.


---
## Other ways to run tests

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b8e7b314c0"
```

`@part1`
```
python -m unittest discover
```{{1}}

```
python -m unittest discover -s [path]
```{{2}}
Both commands search for modules starting with a **test** prefix (for example, **test**Component1.py) {{3}}


`@script`
There are other ways to run tests. For example, this command will search for all the test modules in the current directory and run the corresponding tests. To define a specific directory it is possible to add the following argument. It is important though that for modules to be recognized by these commands, they have to start with a test prefix. Another way to run tests is to include this code at the end of your test module and run the following command: python testComponent1.py

## Final Slide

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "843cf2a1ec"
```

`@script`
